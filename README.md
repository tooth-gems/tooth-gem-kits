# What Is a Tooth Gem and How Much Does It Cost?
If you're thinking about adding a little sparkle to your smile, tooth gems might be the perfect accessory. Before you book your appointment or place an order, here’s everything you need to know about what a tooth gem is, how much it costs, and how to choose the best one for your smile.

## What Is a Tooth Gem?
A tooth gem is a small jewel that is safely bonded to the surface of your tooth using [dental adhesive]. It can be applied by a dentist, hygienist, tattoo artist, or beauty professional with proper training. When done correctly, [tooth gems](https://www.selfgem.com/en/collections/tooth-gems) are completely safe, do not cause permanent damage, and can be removed easily without pain.

They come in a variety of materials and designs, including solid gold, real diamonds, sapphires, and Swarovski crystals. These gems are made for oral use and are free from harmful metals like lead or nickel. With the right care, a tooth gem can last for months or even years.

## How Much Does a Tooth Gem Cost?
Tooth gem prices vary depending on the materials used. Here is a general breakdown:

- Swarovski crystals and similar gems: around $30 to $50
- Solid gold or diamond gems: $100 or more

Keep in mind, these prices typically do not include the application fee at a professional clinic. You will want a qualified expert to apply the gem using proper adhesive that won’t harm your enamel.

## Are Tooth Gems Permanent?
No, tooth gems are not permanent. They are designed to be a temporary cosmetic accessory. Some people choose to wear them for just a few weeks, while others keep them on for years. If you ever want to remove or change your gem, a dentist can do it safely in a matter of minutes.

## Are DIY Tooth Gems Safe?
We do not recommend applying a tooth gem yourself. Cheap materials may contain toxic metals and low-quality adhesives can damage your teeth or gums. A professional will use safe, dental-grade adhesive and proper tools to avoid any harm.
